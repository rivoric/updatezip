UpdateZip
---------

The inspiration for this utility came when I needed to programatically change environment variables inside a jar file
(which is just a zip file with a different name).
As with any working software, additional requests come in and this is an attempt to properly flesh out the functionality.

For usage, please see the in-built help.
